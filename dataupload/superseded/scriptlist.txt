Before running one needs to open ArcGIS Pro and login...


WRD Dataset Code:

D:\R9Data\CentralBasin3D\Automate\Automate2-1.py 
- used to create new combined all chemicals for WRD data and chemicals
- the above script takes about 132+ minutes to run
- the above script is only needed for the initial compiling of the base WRD wells and WRD Chemicals
- This likely needs to be ran about twice a year when they give us new data
- to run this use this in the cmd prompt: "D:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe" automate2-1.py

D:\R9Data\CentralBasin3D\Automate\subset2-1.py - used to create subset of just a given chemical for WRD dataset
- works on D:\R9Data\CentralBasin3D\Automate\AutomateResults.gdb\WRDWellsWithChemicals
- to run this put this in cmd prompt: "D:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe" subset2-1.py
- takes about 1 minute to run (for three chemicals)


GAMA Dataset Code:

D:\R9Data\CentralBasin3D\Gama\subgama2-1.py - used to create subset (D:/R9Data/CentralBasin3D/Gama/gama.gdb/gama_all_losangeles2020_05_06WM2) of just a given chemical for GAMA dataset
- to run this put this in cmd prompt: "D:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3\python.exe" subgama2-1.py
- takes about 18 minute to run (for three chemicals)
